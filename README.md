# Rabin-Karp Algorithm 
Rabin-Karp algorithm is an algorithm used for searching/matching patterns in the text using a hash function. 
Unlike Naive string matching algorithm, it does not travel through every character in the initial phase rather 
it filters the characters that do not match and then performs the comparison.

### To run my code:
• Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Vladysuk/Algo_Lab_5.git`

• Enter your data in `rabin_karp.in`

• And use command: `py main.py`
